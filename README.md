#  Case Study: Driving Cross-Sell Adoption in TNG Digital’s GO+ & GOpinjam

---

## 1.  Context & Challenge

TNG Digital has established itself as Malaysia’s leading eWallet with **23M verified users**.  
Its next growth phase depends on **cross-selling financial products** such as:

- **GO+** – a micro-investment/savings product (currently ~4M users).  
- **GOpinjam** – a micro-loan product launched with banks (adoption still nascent).  

**Current Challenges**
- GO+ users often keep balances low (treated like a reload buffer).  
- GOpinjam struggles with both awareness and risk (default rates, regulatory constraints).  

**Strategic Opportunity**
- Increase stickiness & engagement.  
- Diversify beyond payments revenue.  
- Improve profitability ahead of expected breakeven.

## 2.  Analytics Approach

###  ✅ Step 1: Diagnose Adoption & Retention
1. **Adoption Funnel**
   - Awareness → Interest → First-time Use → Repeat Use → Long-term Retention.  
   - Hypothesis: Drop-off happens at *repeat use stage* for both GO+ and GOpinjam.  

2. **Cohort Analysis**
   - Track GO+ users who also use GOpinjam vs. single-product users.  
   - Compare retention, ARPU, loan repayment patterns.  

3. **Behavioral Segmentation**
   - Segment by income level, spending patterns, top-up frequency.  
   - Identify “prime cross-sell” users (e.g., frequent top-uppers but low GO+ balance → potential GOpinjam prospects).

###  ✅ Step 2: Propose Data-Driven Improvements

**Cross-Sell Levers**
1. **GO+ → GOpinjam**  
   - Lower loan rates if user maintains a GO+ balance (like GrabPay Later loyalty tiers).  
   - Trigger push notifications: *“Maintain RM200 in GO+, unlock lower borrowing rates.”*  

2. **GOpinjam → GO+**  
   - Auto-savings feature: after repaying loan installments, round-up balance into GO+.  
   - *“Repay smart → Grow smart”* campaigns.  

3. **Retention Mechanics**  
   - Rewards tiers (e.g., bonus GOProtect coverage if GO+ balance + GOpinjam repayment history is consistent).  
   - Merchant ecosystem integration: cashback if spending with GO+ balance.  

---

### ✅ Step 3: Define Success Metrics

**Adoption Metrics**
- % of GO+ users cross-using GOpinjam.  
- Loan application-to-approval conversion rate.  
- Activation rate (first-to-second use).  

**Retention Metrics**
- 30-day / 90-day product retention.  
- Average GO+ balance growth.  
- Loan repayment punctuality & repeat borrowing.  

**Monetization Metrics**
- Incremental ARPU of cross-sell users vs. single-product users.  
- Loan book growth (RM).  
- Net profit contribution of finance products as % of total revenue.

## 3.  Forecast Scenarios

### 📈 Scenario 1: Cross-Selling Succeeds (Optimistic Growth)
- GO+ expands to **7M users (~30% wallet base)**.  
- GOpinjam loan book grows to **RM1–2b** with lower credit risk via loyalty-linked tiers.  
- Insurance add-ons (GOProtect) bundled into cross-sell ecosystem.  
- **2027 Revenue**: RM 650–700m  
- **Net Profit Margin**: 20–25%  
- **Result**: TNG Digital transforms into a **fintech profit engine**, IPO-ready.  

---

### 📉 Scenario 2: Cross-Selling Falters (Flat Growth)
- GO+ users remain stagnant (~4–5M) with small balances.  
- GOpinjam faces high defaults, regulatory caps limit expansion.  
- Low penetration of insurance/wealth products due to financial literacy gaps.  
- **2027 Revenue**: RM 350–400m  
- **Net Profit Margin**: <10% (some loss quarters).  
- **Result**: TNG remains a **payments-first company**, vulnerable to banks/GrabPay/Boost.  

---

## 4.  Key Insight

The success of TNG’s financial ecosystem depends on treating cross-sell not as separate products but as a **loyalty-driven loop**:

- **GO+** anchors savings habit.  
- **GOpinjam** monetizes credit demand.  
- Retention comes from bundling + ecosystem rewards.  

Analytics should **continuously measure cross-sell uplift, segment cohorts, and optimize triggers** until the ecosystem forms a **self-reinforcing retention engine**.

## 5.  ✏️ Takeaway for My Product Analytics Role

If I were on TNG’s product analytics team, my impact would be to:
- Diagnose where adoption breaks down with funnel & cohort analysis.  
- Design A/B tests for cross-sell triggers (e.g., loan rate discount for GO+ savers).  
- Monitor long-term ARPU uplift from cross-sell cohorts.  
- Present management with **forecast scenarios** to guide product roadmap & capital allocation.
