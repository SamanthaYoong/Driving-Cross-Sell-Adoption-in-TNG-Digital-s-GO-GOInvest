#  Case Study: Driving Cross-Sell Adoption from GO+ to GOInvest ✅

## 1. Problem Statement  
How can **TNG Digital** increase **GOInvest new users** by converting **active GO+ users**, while addressing the **trust gap** and **low-barrier entry perception** of eWallet-based investments?

- **Current state:** GO+ has wide adoption as a “starter” investment (low entry, liquidity, safe yield).  
- **Challenge:** Many GO+ users don’t progress to GOInvest, due to risk perception, lack of financial literacy, and trust in higher-risk products.  
- **Key Goal:** Build trust, guide users across the funnel, and increase GOInvest penetration.

## 2. Business Context  

- **GO+:** Micro-savings, highly liquid, low yield (~2% p.a.), positioned as “safe”. Acts as a user’s first exposure to financial services in TNG eWallet.  
- **GOInvest:** Access to unit trusts and diversified funds (equities, mixed assets, syariah-compliant). Higher yields, but with market risk.  

**User Funnel (current):**  
`Sign-up → eWallet Active → GO+ Adoption → (Drop-off) → GOInvest Adoption`  

**Drop-off point:** Trust gap when moving from low-risk GO+ to riskier GOInvest.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis (Why users don’t convert)  

- **Trust & Risk Aversion:** Users perceive GOInvest as “risky” compared to GO+.  
- **Financial Literacy Gap:** Uncertainty about investment products, fear of losses.  
- **Product Positioning:** GO+ is seen as a “wallet extension,” GOInvest as a “finance leap.”  
- **Onboarding UX:** Current nudges from GO+ → GOInvest may be too transactional (ads, banners) instead of educational & personalized.

  - Highlight GOInvest’s track record in simple terms.  

- **Segmentation-Based Messaging**  
  - **Savers (small balances, low frequency):** Nudge with “safe fund” options.  
  - **Builders (medium balances, regular reloads):** Highlight growth potential with diversified funds.  
  - **High-balance holders:** Personal advisor chat + priority offers.  

- **Trust Anchors**

### C. Behavioral Nudges  
- **Personalized In-App Stories**  
  - Example: “Your RM1000 in GO+ earned RM1.50. In GOInvest Balanced Fund, you could’ve earned RM3.20.”  
- **Gamified Progression**  
  - Badge system for “Starter Saver” → “Smart Investor.”  
- **Push Notifications / Banners**  
  - Example: “90% of GO+ users like you start GOInvest within 3 months.” (social proof)

## 5. Metrics & Measurement  

**North Star Metric:**  
- % of GO+ active users who open GOInvest accounts (conversion rate).  

**Supporting Metrics:**

## 6. Expected Business Impact  

- Higher **ARPU** (GOInvest users hold larger balances than GO+).  
- Stronger **financial services penetration** beyond payments.  
- Improved **brand trust** (TNG as a full-stack digital finance platform, not just payments).  
- Diversification of **revenue streams** (management fees, fund commissions).
